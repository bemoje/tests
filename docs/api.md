## tests

Node.js based micro testing framwork with powerful features to more efficiently get those tests over with.
Focus on lightweight testing tiny micro standalone node library modules.
Init automated and not dependent on any plugins to work.
Make errors and stack traces visually easy to read.
Tries to be scalable to other testing platforms, eventually, hopefully, by automated code refactoring..
Parses module exports in source code of sorrrounding files and builds a template from that to get going quickly.
Command-line interface with no parameters. Should figure out what you are trying to do with it by itself, as it doesn't to a lot of fancy stuff - just the basics..
Beginner-friendly for sure.
